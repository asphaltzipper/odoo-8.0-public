For version 8.0, this module adds a new attribute to the Partner form view called 'Payment Preference' which records the preferred method used by this partner to make or receive payments.  This is carried over to Invoices and Payments (where it can be changed).  Payment Preference is renamed 'Payment Method' and Payment Method is renamed 'Paid From' or 'Paid To' respectively for Supplier and Customer payments.
